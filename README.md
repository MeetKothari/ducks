# ducks
A project I coded in the spring semester of my freshman year. The objective of this collection of files was to use C programming, specifically polymorphic circularly linked lists, to implement a solution to the following problem: suppose there are n ducks floating on the pond in a circle. The pond is also home for an alligator with a fondness for ducks. Beginning at the 1st position, the alligator counts around the circle and eats every mth duck (the circle closing as ducks are eaten). The fifth duck is the first on the menu, the first duck is second, etc. Write a program which prints out the order of disappearance of the ducks given n (number of ducks) and m (interval to the next duck to be eaten) to the screen. At least one blank must separate each number. The values of m and n are to be entered from the keyboard via standard input.

Hello, to anyone viewing this code. I am allowing it to be used for educational and recreational purposes only; I do not condone cheating in any way, shape, or form.
